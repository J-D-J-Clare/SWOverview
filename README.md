This repository aims to provide code/data associated with a manuscript that is either pre-review or in review
at present. This is a w-i-p; once finalized will be archived elsewhere. Will evolve as I try to figure out how 
to best balance reproducibility with certain data privacies based on collaborator/funder wishes. (The short is
that these are a bunch of spatial analyses, and there is interest in keeping locations private, so we will see
how this goes). The manuscript is organized into 6 case studies, and that organization will be followed here.
