This repository aims to provide code/data associated with a manuscript that is either pre-review or in review
at present. The manuscript is organized into 6 case studies, and that organization will be followed here. 
This is a w-i-p; once finalized will be archived elsewhere. This will evolve as I try to figure out how 
to best balance reproducibility with certain data privacies based on collaborator/funder wishes. (The short is
that these are a bunch of spatial analyses, and there is interest in keeping locations private, so we will see
how this goes). 

At present (6/2020), not all of the code will actually work because size constraints make it impossible to
deposit certain data, and the smaller data files that could be manipulated inline cannot be postered here.
In the long run, I think the best that can be done is to be able to give examples of how some of the more
non-standard elements of the analysis were executed and to provide function calls that may clarify the more 
rote things.
